TDD(Test Driven Development) Framework - TestNG or JUnit based framework that uses @Test annotations to create tests

Steps of creating TestNG based framework from scratch:
1. Create a maven project
2. Add project specific dependencies
3. Add .gitignore
4. Create the package structure
5. Add TestBase and necessary test classes (don't forget to extend your test classes from TestBase)
6. Add testng.xml file to configure different test runs
7. Add .properties file with project specific global properties like urls, username, passwords ,etc.
   (never hardcode properties like urls, passwords, api keys into the code, rather use properties file)
8. Add the utility class to read from the property file (ConfigReader)
9. Add the Driver utility class that is implemented using Singleton design pattern
10. Add Selenium Utility class for re-usable selenium methods and add more methods as needed as you progress in your progress
11. Start creating the Page classes for each page of the application and add the WebElements and related methods
11. Create test cases using the Page classes and their methods according to Page Object Model design pattern
12. Add a support for running tests through CMD by configuring the Maven Surefire plugin in pom.xml


13. Add Extent report dependency and configure Test Base class for the report generation
14. Configure the Driver class to add headless browser options for each browser
15. Add a support for Cross-Browser testing
16. Add a support for Parallel Testing




Singleton Design Pattern -> A design pattern where an instantiation of a class is restricted to only one object.
                           An example could be the Driver class where the Webdriver instantiation is done by getDriver() method that checks if the WebDriver obj is already initialized.
                           The purpose of using this pattern is to prevent multiple WebDriver objects being initialized.

Page Object Model Design Pattern -> A design pattern specific to Selenium based UI test frameworks which is implemented by creating a separate class for each page of our
                                    application which stores the page web elements and methods.
                                    The purpose is re-usability, maintainability and readability.
PageFactory class ->      This style uses @FindBy annotations to locate the elements and makes our Page classes more readable and concise.
                                   We implement it by using PageFactory.initElements() method in a constructor of the page class
                                   We also can use @FindBys to create chained matches and @FindAll to match multiple webelements on the page

To run tests thru CMD in TestNG framework:

1. Add Maven Surefire plugin to the pom.xml
2. Configure it to run different xml files.
   Add the following configuration:
                <plugin>
                    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
                    <version>3.0.0</version>
                    <configuration>
                        <suiteXmlFiles>
                            <suiteXmlFile>${xmlFile}</suiteXmlFile>   // syntax for the name of the placeholder -> ${placeholderName}
                        </suiteXmlFiles>
                    </configuration>
                </plugin>
3. In the command line run the tests with the -D switch, indicating the value for placeholder:
         mvn test -D xmlFile=regression-suite.xml
   or    mvn test -D xmlFile=smoke-test-suite.xml
